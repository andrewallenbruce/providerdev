## Core Functionality

Representative of the initial aim: quick access to **current** Healthcare Provider information that is **administrative** in nature:

1.  `affiliations()`
2.  `clinicians()`
3.  `crosswalk()`
4.  `hospitals()`
5.  `laboratories()`
6.  `nppes()`
7.  `opt_out()`
8.  `order_refer()`
9.  `providers()`
10. `reassignments()`
11. `pending()`
12. `taxonomies()`

## Value â‰¥ Complexity Added?

Added value is significant, but tooling, maintenance, etc. much more complex than the core functionality.

1.  `quality_payment()`
2.  `quality_eligibility()`
3.  `open_payments()`
4.  `utilization()`
5.  `prescribers()`

## Questioning: Out of Scope

Surplus to requirements, e.g. historical provider data (either kept current or no longer updated), an applicable area of interest large enough to be moved into its own package, or tangential functionality:

1.  `outpatient()`
2.  `beneficiaries()`
