To retrieve datasets larger than this threshold, you must execute multiple requests, incrementing the offset each time to paginate through results:\n\n   1. Fetch the first 2000 results:\n\n```r\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/datastore/query/\n   7t8x-u3ir/0?\n   offset=0\n```\n\n   2. Fetch the next 2000 results (2001-4000):\n\n```r\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/datastore/query/\n   7t8x-u3ir/0?\n   offset=2000\n```\n\nContinue this pattern, incrementing the offset by 2,000 for each subsequent batch.\n\nWhile retrieving large datasets, consider pacing your requests to avoid overwhelming your system with data and to allow for graceful error handling. Depending on the volume of data and your application's capabilities, consider implementing a back-off strategy if errors occur.\n\n## Star Ratings & Overall Care Ratings\n\nCMS's **Five-Star Quality Rating System** is designed to help users compare the overall quality of care across different healthcare providers. Access these ratings by referring to the associated column names:\n\n   * Nursing Homes: `overall_rating`\n   * Hospitals: `hospital_overall_rating`\n   * Dialysis Facilities: `five_star`\n   * Hospice: `star_rating`\n   * Home Health: `quality_of_patient_care_star_rating`\n\nFor example, the query for the [**Nursing Homes**](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py) dataset for facilities with a 5-star overall rating:\n\n```r\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/\n   datastore/query/\n   4pq5-n9py/\n   0?\n   conditions[0][property]=overall_rating&\n   conditions[0][value]=5&\n   conditions[0][operator]==\n```\n\n## Querying for Specific Conditions\n\nThe recommended method is to use the datastore query endpoint: `datastore/query/{datasetID}/{index}`\n\nThe datastore query endpoint takes two arguments: the `datasetID`, which can be obtained from the URL of the dataset and does not change between data refreshes, and the index of the distribution. Currently on PDC, the index will always be zero.\n\nAs an example, if you want to pull the first 500 results for a specific dataset that has a rating column called `overall_rating`, you would first identify the dataset that has the specific column such as this:\n\n```r\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py\n```\n\nand then you would use \n\n```r\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/datastore/query/4pq5-n9py/0\n```\nThe results can be filtered further. For example, to return the first 500 results with an overall rating of 5, you would use the following:\n\n```r\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/\n   datastore/query/\n   4pq5-n9py/\n   0?\n   conditions[0][property]=overall_rating&\n   conditions[0][value]=5&\n   conditions[0][operator]==\n```\n\nMore complex queries can be created in JSON and converted to an HTTP query string by using [JSON Query to String](https://www.convertonline.io/convert/json-to-query-string).\n\nFor example, to return just the CMS certification number and overall rating columns that have an overall rating greater than 3, you could use the following JSON:\n\n```r\n{\n    \"properties\": [\n        \"cms_certification_number_ccn\",\n        \"overall_rating\"\n    ],\n    \"conditions\": [\n        {\n            \"property\":\"overall_rating\",\n            \"value\": \"3\",\n            \"operator\": \">\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhich converts to a query string of:\n\n```r\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/\n   datastore/query/\n   4pq5-n9py/\n   0?\n   properties[]=cms_certification_number_ccn&\n   properties[]=overall_rating&\n   conditions[0][property]=overall_rating&\n   conditions[0][value]=3&\n   conditions[0][operator]=>\n```\n\n## Retrieve List of All Dataset IDs\n\nYes, you can retrieve a comprehensive list of all datasets available on the PDC site by leveraging the metastore schema endpoint:\n\n```r\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/metastore/schemas/dataset/items\n```\n\nFor developers looking to work with multiple datasets programmatically, consider utilizing JSON parsing tools or custom scripts to extract and manage these IDs efficiently. For example, using a `curl` command in the terminal followed by a tool like `jq` can streamline the process:\n\n```r\ncurl https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/metastore/schemas/dataset/items | jq '.[] | {id: .identifier, name: .title}'\n```\n\nThis command fetches the list of datasets and uses `jq` to parse the JSON response, extracting the identifier and title of each dataset.\n\n## Filter List of Dataset IDs\n\nYou can get a list of all public datasets for a Topic area via the /api/1/search endpoint. For example, to get a list of all datasets in the Home health services Topic, you could use:\n\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/search?page-size=100&theme=Home%20health%20services\n\n(Note that “%20” is inserted for the spaces between words in a Topic name.)\n\nIf the page size is not provided, the default result limit is 10.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to use this feature is to set up your search parameters on the Provider Data Catalog  search page (https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/search) and then copy the query string to the end of the search endpoint.\n\nFor example, if you filter by “Dialysis facilities” tagged with “Linking Quality to Payment” and select 25 results per page, the query string produced is: ?keyword=Linking%20Quality%20to%20Payment&page-size=25&theme=Dialysis%20facilities\n\nYou can append this query string to the search endpoint to get a list of all datasets that meet that criteria, like this:\n\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/search?keyword=Linking%20Quality%20to%20Payment&page-size=25&theme=Dialysis%20facilities.\n\nYou can also use the same method to return a list of datasets that contain a keyword like “ratings” in their title and/or description:\n\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/search?fulltext=ratings\n\n## Difference Between Metastore & Datastore\n\nDatastore: data from the data files (CSVs) and Metastore: metadata properties about the dataset  from the data.json file (e.g. dataset title, last updated date, release date, keywords, etc.)\n\nThink of the Metastore as the library index that helps you find the right book (dataset), and the Datastore as the book itself, containing all the detailed information (data entries) you need.\n\n## Distribution & Dataset IDs\n\nDistribution ID - the unique identifier of the datastore. The distribution ID is specific to a particular CSV data import, so it changes with every data refresh.\n\nDataset ID -  the unique identifier of the dataset  The Dataset ID comes from the data.json file and appears as part of the URL in the PDC site and it does not change between refreshes.\n\nThe Distribution ID changes with every data refresh.\n\nIf you have been using the datastore/sql or datastore/query/{distributionId} endpoints to pull data, you might consider switching to use the datastore/query/{datasetID}/{index} endpoint instead. The datasetID does not change between refreshes, and currently all datasets in the Provider Data Catalog have only a single resource, so the index will always be zero.\n\nAs an example, to pull the data for the long term care hospital dataset at https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/5zdx-ny2x you could use\n\nhttps://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/datastore/query/5zdx-ny2x/0\n\nSince Distribution IDs change with every dataset update, if you are creating an automated script, it is better to use APIs with the Dataset ID and the index of the distribution. (Please see “Do the Distribution IDs change?” for more information.)\n\nIf you still need the current distribution ID, you can find it by viewing the dataset metadata API.  /api/1/metastore/schemas/dataset/items/[datasetID]?show-reference-ids under distribution -> identifier\n\n## Data\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprovider_data() |> \n  purse()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n- $accessLevel              c234 public                                     ...\n- $landingPage              c234 https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset ...\n- $bureauCode               c234 009:38                                     ...\n- $issued                   c234 2020-03-14                                 ...\n- $type                     c234 dcat:Dataset                               ...\n- $modified                 c234 2024-12-21                                 ...\n- $released                 c234 2024-10-23                                 ...\n- $keyword                  c234 Quality, Quality Measures                  ...\n- $contactPoint_type        c234 vcard:Contact                              ...\n- $contactPoint_fn          c234 Dialysis Facility Helpdesk                 ...\n- $contactPoint_hasEmail    c234 mailto:DialysisData@umich.edu              ...\n- $contactPoint_hasURL      c234 NA                                         ...\n- $publisher_type           c234 org:Organization                           ...\n- $publisher_name           c234 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( ...\n- $identifier               c234 23ew-n7w9                                  ...\n- $description              c234 A list of all dialysis facilities register ...\n- $title                    c234 Dialysis Facility -
