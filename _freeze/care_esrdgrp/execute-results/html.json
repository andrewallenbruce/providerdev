The supplementary aggregation group crosswalk file may be used to map aggregation groups to individual ETC Participant ESRD facilities.]{.aside}\n\n## Metadata\n\n::: {.cell}\n<pre class=\"r-output\"><code>       [ROWS] 421 \n   [MODIFIED] 2024-08-09 \n[PERIODICITY] Monthly [R/P1M] \n   [TEMPORAL] 2021-12-01 • 2023-06-30 \n [DICTIONARY] https://data.cms.gov/resources/esrd-facility-aggregation-group-performance-data-dictionary \n       [SITE] https://data.cms.gov/cms-innovation-center-programs/disease-episode-based-payment-models/end-stage-renal-disease-facility-aggregation-group-performance \n [REFERENCES] https://data.cms.gov/resources/esrd-treatment-choices-etc-model-methodology \n  [RESOURCES] https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset-resources/4bae4223-a1dc-4b9c-bd7e-d9622461be35 \n   [DOWNLOAD] https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2024-07/245da9ee-780e-41d3-8262-55a3c93c7f4a/ETC-MY4-DF-ModelDetailedResults.csv \n</code></pre>\n:::\n\n### Resources\n\n::: {.cell}\n<pre class=\"r-output\"><code>[ CSV] 2023 ESRD Facility Aggregation Group Performance Jun ( 54.5K)\n[ PDF] 2023 ESRD Facility Aggregation Group Performance Data Dictionary (852K)\n[ PDF] 2023 ETC Model Methodology (117.3K)\n[XLSX] 2023 ETC-MY2-AG-Crosswalk (436.3K)\n[XLSX] 2023 ETC-MY1-AG-Crosswalk (421.7K)\n[XLSX] 2023 ETC-MY3-AG-Crosswalk (411.7K)\n[XLSX] 2023 ETC-MY4-AG-Crosswalk (405.7K)\n</code></pre>\n:::\n\n### Dictionary\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<pre class=\"r-output\"><code><pre style=''>\n<span style='text-decoration:underline;'>                field                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     description</span><br/>1   <span style='color:#808080;'><span>           AGG_ID</span></span><span style='color:#808080;'><span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Aggregation Group ID.

Only applicable from Measurement Year 3 onwards.</span></span><br/>22  <span style='color:#808080;'><span>    TR_DELIS_DIFF</span></span><span style='color:#808080;'><span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Difference between the Benchmark Year and Measurement Year in the Transplant Rate for attributed ESRD beneficiaries who are dual eligible or Low Income Subsidy recipients (DE/LIS).
