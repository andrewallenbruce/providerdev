    "FFM Registration takes place on the CMS Enterprise Portal, where agents and brokers create an FFM User Account, complete identity proofing, and complete training through either a CMS-approved third-party vendor or the Marketplace Learning Management System (MLMS) provided by CMS. In addition, all agents and brokers must electronically sign the applicable Agreement(s) on the MLMS. The applicable state(s) should be contacted to confirm the licensure status of agents and brokers. If there is an inquiry regarding the licensure status of an NPN, the inquiry should be routed to NIPR customer service (http://www.nipr.com/index_contacts.htm).
