The MAQI Demonstration will be tested under the authority of Section 402 of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 (as amended).\nThe MAQI Demonstration is designed to test whether exempting Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) -eligible clinicians who participate to a sufficient degree in certain payment arrangements with Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) from the MIPS reporting requirements and payment adjustment will increase or maintain participation in payment arrangements similar to Advanced APMs with MAOs and change the manner in which clinicians deliver care. In the 2019 Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule, released today, CMS is proposing a regulation to effectuate the waivers contemplated under the MAQI Demonstration because the budget neutrality requirement in MIPS means that exempting MIPS eligible clinicians could have an impact on the payment adjustments for other MIPS eligible clinicians. Details of the MAQI Demonstration will remain under development until the 2019 Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule is finalized. The Demonstration will test whether:\n\nThere is an increase in clinician participation in payment arrangements with MAOs that meet the criteria of Qualifying Payment Arrangements\nParticipating in Qualifying Payment Arrangements and Advanced APMs to the degree required to be eligible for the Demonstration Waiver incentivizes providers to transform their care delivery (assessed by interviews with participating clinicians)\nWhether there is a change in utilization patterns among participants in the Demonstration\nIf there are changes in utilization, how those changes affect MA plan bids\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nUnder current law, eligible clinicians may participate in one of two paths of the Quality Payment Program (QPP): 1) MIPS, which adjusts Medicare payments based on combined performance on measures of quality, cost, improvement activities, and promoting interoperability, or 2) Advanced APMs, under which eligible clinicians may earn an incentive payment for sufficient participation in certain payment arrangements with Fee-for-Service (FFS) and, starting in the 2019 performance period, with a combination of those Medicare FFS arrangements and similar arrangements with other payers such as Medicare Advantage commercial payers, and Medicaid managed care. To participate in the Advanced APM path of QPP for a given year and earn an incentive payment, eligible clinicians must be determined to be Qualifying APM Participants (QPs); in addition to earning an APM incentive payment, QPs are excluded from the MIPS reporting requirements and payment adjustment.\nAn eligible clinician may become a QP through one of two options: the Medicare Option (which only includes Medicare FFS, not Medicare Advantage), or the All-Payer Combination Option. Under the Medicare Option, which began with the 2017 performance period, eligible clinicians can be QPs if they meet certain thresholds for participation in Advanced APMs, which are Medicare FFS payment arrangements that meet certain criteria. Under the All-Payer Combination Option, which will begin with the 2019 performance period, eligible clinicians can also be QPs if they meet a minimum threshold for participation in Advanced APMs (lower than the threshold required under the Medicare Option) and certain All-Payer Combination Option thresholds that include participation in both Advanced APMs and Other Payer Advanced APMs, which are payment arrangements with other payers that meet similar criteria to those for Advanced APMs. Eligible clinicians who do not meet the thresholds to become QPs for a year can meet lower thresholds to become “Partial QPs,” which allows them the option to be excluded from the MIPS reporting requirements and payment adjustment, but does not earn them an APM incentive payment. An eligible clinician that does not meet the criteria to be a QP or a Partial QP for a given year is subject to MIPS for that year unless the clinician meets certain other MIPS exclusion criteria, such as being newly enrolled in Medicare or meeting the low volume threshold for Medicare FFS patients, payments, or services.\nThe MAQI Demonstration will allow participating clinicians to have the opportunity to be eligible for waivers that will exempt them from the MIPS reporting requirements and payment adjustment for a given year if they participate to a sufficient degree in Qualifying Payment Arrangements with MAOs (combined with participation in Advanced APMs with Medicare FFS, if any) during the performance period for that year, without requiring them to be QPs or Partial QPs, or to otherwise meet MIPS exclusion criteria. The Demonstration will permit consideration of participation in “Qualifying Payment Arrangements” with Medicare Advantage plans that meet the criteria to be Other Payer Advanced APMs a year before the All-Payer Combination Option is available. Under the Demonstration, clinicians will not have to have a minimum amount of participation in an Advanced APM with Medicare FFS in order to be exempt from the MIPS reporting requirements and payment adjustment for a year. However, if clinicians participate in one or more Advanced APMs with Medicare FFS, that participation will also be counted towards the thresholds that qualify participants for the waiver under this Demonstration from the MIPS reporting requirements and payment adjustment. Demonstration participants who do not meet the thresholds to receive waivers from MIPS reporting requirements and payment adjustments for a given year may still continue participation in the Demonstration and will be notified with sufficient time to complete MIPS reporting for the year. The Demonstration will not grant QP status to participating clinicians; participating clinicians would still have to meet the thresholds for participation under the Medicare Option or All-Payer Combination Option in order to become QPs and earn the incentive payment.\nUnder section 1848(q)(6)(F)(ii) of the Act, MIPS payment adjustments must be budget neutral in the aggregate. Therefore, removing MIPS eligible clinicians from the population across which positive and negative payment adjustments are calculated under MIPS may affect the payment adjustments for other MIPS eligible clinicians. The Demonstration would remove certain clinicians from the pool of MIPS eligible clinicians for which the MIPS payment adjustments are calculated, thereby decreasing the pool of MIPS eligible clinicians included in the budget neutrality determination. This may have the effect of increasing or decreasing the number of MIPS eligible clinicians receiving negative or positive payment adjustments. The Demonstration is contingent on the outcome of the proposed rule to adopt the waivers because of its effect on MIPS payment adjustments for other clinicians.\nIn addition, the MAQI demonstration will include a waiver of the requirement that the Secretary permit all eligible professionals to voluntarily report even if they are not required to do so under MIPS regulations, so that the Demonstration will prohibit reporting under the MIPS by clinicians who participate in the Demonstration and meet the thresholds to receive the waivers from MIPS reporting and payment consequences for a given year.\nThe first performance period for the Demonstration will be 2018, and the Demonstration will last for five years.\n\nQualifying Thresholds for Waiver\nEligibility for the Demonstration Waiver is conditioned on the participating clinician meeting a combined threshold for participation in Qualifying Payment Arrangements and Advanced APMs. There are two methods used to measure participation: payments and patients. The participation thresholds match the thresholds under the Medicare Option of the QPP. Similar to the QPP, clinicians may meet either of the two thresholds and the Demonstration will use whichever threshold is more advantageous to the clinician.\nThe thresholds for the Demonstration will be:\n\n\nPerformance Year\nPayment Amount\nPatient Count\n\n\n\n2018\n25%\n20%\n\n\n2019\n50%\n35%\n\n\n2020\n50%\n35%\n\n\n2021\n75%\n50%\n\n\n2022\n75%\n50%\n\n\n\nThe payment amount threshold score will be calculated by dividing a numerator (the aggregate of payments for Medicare Part B covered professional services furnished by the clinician during the Performance Period to beneficiaries attributed to the clinician through Advanced APM(s), plus the aggregate of MAO payments made to the clinician under the terms of the Qualifying Payment Arrangement(s) during the Performance Period) by a denominator (the aggregate of payments for Medicare Part B covered professional services furnished by the clinician to all eligible beneficiaries during the Performance Period, plus the aggregate of all MAO payments to the clinician during the Performance Period). The definition of eligible beneficiaries is listed below.\nThe patient count threshold score will be calculated by dividing a numerator (the number of beneficiaries attributed to the clinician through Advanced APM(s) to whom the clinician furnishes Medicare Part B covered professional services during the Performance Period, plus the number of patients to whom the clinician furnishes services that are included in the measures of aggregate expenditures used under the terms of all of their Qualifying Payment Arrangements during the Performance Period) by a denominator (the number of eligible beneficiaries to whom the clinician furnishes Medicare Part B covered professional services during the Performance Period, plus the number of beneficiaries to whom the clinician furnishes services for which MAOs pay during the Performance Period).\nThe definition of eligible beneficiaries as used in the Medicare FFS component of the denominators will be Medicare FFS beneficiaries who, during the Performance Period, are not enrolled in Medicare Advantage or a Medicare cost plan, do not have Medicare as a secondary payer, are enrolled in both Medicare Parts A and B, are at least 18 years of age, and are United States residents.\nPayment Amount Method\nAmount Through Qualifying Payment Arrangements \\(+\\) Amount Through Advanced APMs \\(=\\) Total from MAOs and Medicare FFS\nPatient Count Method\n\\(n\\) Beneficiaries under Qualifying Payment Arrangements \\(+\\) \\(n\\) Beneficiaries under Advanced APMS \\(=\\) Total \\(n\\) Beneficiaries under MAOs and Medicare FFS",

\"state\",\n        \"overall_rating\"\n    ],\n    \"conditions\": [\n        {\n            \"property\": \"overall_rating\",\n            \"operator\": \"&gt;\",\n            \"value\": \"3\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\nThis converts to a query string of:\n\nccnr3 &lt;- url_parse(\n  base_url = \"https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/\", \n  url      = \"api/1/datastore/query/4pq5-n9py/0\") |&gt; \n

/api/1/search endpoint. For example, to get a list of all datasets in the Home health services Topic, you could use:\n\ntheme &lt;- url_parse(\n  base_url = \"https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/\",\n  url      = \"api/1/search?\") |&gt; \n  url_modify_query(\n    `page-size` = 100,\n    theme       = \"Home health services\") |&gt; \n  url_build() |&gt; \n  request() |&gt; \n  req_perform() |&gt; \n  resp_body_json(simplifyVector = TRUE)\n\ntheme$total\n\ntheme$facets |&gt; \n  filter(total &gt; 1)\n\nnames(theme$results)\n\n\nNote: If the page-size is not provided, the default result limit is 10.\n\nkeyword\nOne of the easiest ways to generate your search parameters is to use the Provider Data Catalog search page and then copy the query string to the end of the search endpoint. For example, if you filter by “Dialysis facilities” tagged with “Linking Quality to Payment” and select 25 results per page, the query string produced is:\n\nx &lt;- request(\n  paste0(\n    \"https://data.cms.gov/\",\n    \"provider-data/api/1/\",\n    \"search?\",\n    \"keyword=Linking%20Quality%20to%20Payment&\",\n    \"page-size=25&\",\n    \"theme=Dialysis%20facilities\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  req_perform() |&gt; \n  resp_body_json(simplifyVector = TRUE)\n\nx$facets |&gt; \n  tibble() |&gt; \n  mutate(across(where(is.character),  ~ na_if(.x, \"\"))) |&gt; \n  remove_all_na()\n\nx$results\n\nfulltext\nUse the same method to return a list of datasets that contain a keyword (like “ratings”) in their title and/or description:\n\nx &lt;- request(\n  paste0(\n    \"https://data.cms.gov/\",\n    \"provider-data/api/1/\",\n    \"search?\",\n    \"fulltext=ratings\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  req_perform() |&gt; \n  resp_body_json(simplifyVector = TRUE)\n\nx$facets |&gt; \n  tibble() |&gt; \n  mutate(across(where(is.character),  ~ na_if(.x, \"\"))) |&gt; \n  remove_all_na()\n\nx$results",

If you still need the current distribution ID, you can access it through the metadata API, under distribution -&gt; identifier:\n\"https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/metastore/schemas/dataset/items/[datasetID]?show-reference-ids\"",

It provides a zero-configuration required, opinionated, way to allow RESTful CRUD for a Drupal site’s content.\nIt is closely coupled to Drupal’s Entity and Field APIs, response caching, and authentication and authorization systems. Because it follows the shared JSON:API conventions it can help increase productivity and allow you to take advantage of non-Drupal specific tooling.\nRefer to the Drupal documentation for more information on filtering API requests.",

    "section": "Filtering",
    "text": "Filtering\nCollections are listings of resources. When you make an unfiltered request to a collection endpoint like /jsonapi/node/article, you’ll just get every article that you’re allowed to see. Without filters, you can’t get only the articles that you want.\nThe simplest, most common filter is a key-value filter:\n/data?\n   filter[field_1]=value_1&\n   filter[field_2]=value_2\nThis matches all resources with field_1 equal to \"value_1\" and field_2 equal to \"value_2\".\nConditions\nThe fundamental building blocks of JSON:API filters are Conditions and Groups.\n\n\nConditions assert that something is TRUE\n\n\nGroups compose sets of conditions\n\nThose sets can be nested to make super fine queries. You can think of a nested set as a tree:\nConventional representation:\n\nis_A &lt;- \\(x) any(x == \"A\")\nis_B &lt;- \\(x) any(x == \"B\")\nis_C &lt;- \\(x) any(x == \"C\")\nis_D &lt;- \\(x) any(x == \"D\")\nis_E &lt;- \\(x) any(x == \"E\")\n\nx &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n\nis_A(x[is_B(x) & is_C(x[is_D(x) | is_E(x)])])\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nx &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"F\", \"G\")\n\nis_A(x[is_B(x) & is_C(x[is_D(x) | is_E(x)])])\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nTree representation:\n   A\n  / \\\n B & C\n    / \\\n   D | E\nIn both representations:\n\n\nD & E are members of C in an OR group\n\nB & C are members of A in an AND group\n\nA condition has 3 primary parts:\n\n\n[path]: Dataset Field\n\n\n[operator]: Logical comparison\n\n[value]: Dataset Row\n\n\nIn JSON:API syntax, these are formatted as a key=value pair to work inside a URL query string:\n/data?\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=FIRST_NAME&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][operator]=%3D&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value]=Janis\n\nNote: %3D is the URL-encoded = symbol. All operators must be URL-encoded.\n\nNotice the ID inside the first set of square brackets. Every condition or group should have a unique identifier.\nLet’s add another filter so we only get Janises with a last name that starts with \"J\":\n/data?\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=FIRST_NAME&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][operator]=%3D&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value]=Janis&\n   filter[fID-2][condition][path]=LAST_NAME&\n   filter[fID-2][condition][operator]=STARTS_WITH&\n   filter[fID-2][condition][value]=J\nGroups\nA group is a set of conditions joined by a conjunction, either AND or OR. Let’s say we want to find all users with a last name that starts with “J” and have either the first name “Janis” or “Joan”. To do that, we add a group:\n/data?\n   filter[gID-1][group][conjunction]=OR\nThen, we need assign filters to that new group. To do that, we add a memberOf key. Every condition and group can have a memberOf key.\n/data?\n   filter[gID-1][group][conjunction]=OR&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=first_name&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][operator]=%3D&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value]=Janis&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][memberOf]=gID-1&\n   filter[fID-2][condition][path]=first_name&\n   filter[fID-2][condition][operator]=%3D&\n   filter[fID-2][condition][value]=Joan&\n   filter[fID-2][condition][memberOf]=gID-1&\n   filter[fID-3][condition][path]=last_name&\n   filter[fID-3][condition][operator]=STARTS_WITH&\n   filter[fID-3][condition][value]=J\n\nNote: Groups can have a memberOf key just like conditions, which means you can have groups of groups. Every filter without a memberOf key is assumed to be part of a root group with a conjunction of AND.\n\nDoes that look familiar? It should, we saw it above as a tree:\n   A         A = root & g1\n  / \\\n /   \\       B = f3\nB  &  C      C = g1\n     / \\\n    /   \\    D = f1\n   D  |  E   E = f2\nPaths\nPaths provide a way to filter based on relationship values. Up to this point, we’ve just been filtering by the hypothetical first_name and last_name. Suppose we want to filter by the name of a user’s career, where career types are stored as a separate resource. We could add a filter like this:\n/data?\n   filter[career][condition][path]=field_career.name&\n   filter[career][condition][operator]=%3D&\n   filter[career][condition][value]=DOCTOR\nPaths use a “dot notation” to traverse relationships. If a resource has a relationship, you can add a filter against it by concatenating the relationship field name and the relationship’s field name with a . (dot). You can even filter by relationships of relationships (and so on) just by adding more field names and dots.\nYou can filter on a specific index of a relationship by putting a non-negative integer in the path. So the path some_relationship.1.some_attribute would only filter by the 2nd related resource.\n\nTip: You can filter by sub-properties of a field. For example, a path like field_phone.country_code will work even though field_phone isn’t a relationship.\n\nWhen filtering against configuration properties, you can use an asterisk (*) to stand-in for any portion of a path.\nFor example,\n/api\n/field_config\n/field_config?\n   filter[dependencies.config.*]=comment.type.comment\nwould match all field configs in which [attributes][dependencies][config] (an indexed array) contains the value \"comment.type.comment\".\nShortcuts\nWhen the operator is =, you don’t have to include it:\n/data?\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=FIRST_NAME&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][operator]=%3D&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value]=Janis\nbecomes\n/data?\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=FIRST_NAME&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value]=Janis\nWhen the operator is = and you don’t need to filter by the same field twice, the path can be the identifier:\n/data?\n   filter[FIRST_NAME][value]=Janis\nReduce the simplest equality checks down to a key-value form:\n/data?\n   filter[FIRST_NAME]=Janis\nFilters and Access Control\nFirst, a warning: don’t make the mistake of confusing filters for access control. Just because you’ve written a filter to remove something that a user shouldn’t be able to see, doesn’t mean it’s not accessible. Always perform access checks on the backend.\nWith that big caveat, let’s talk about using filters to complement access control. To improve performance, you should filter out what your users will not be able to see. The most frequent support request in the JSON:API issue queues can be solved by this one simple trick! If you know your users cannot see unpublished content, add the following filter:\n/data?\n   filter[status][value]=1\nUsing this method, you’ll lower the number of unnecessary requests that you need to make. That’s because JSON:API doesn’t return data for resources to which a user doesn’t have access. You can see which resources may have been affected by inspecting the meta.errors section of JSON:API document. So, do your best to filter out inaccessible resources ahead of time.",

While these work when typed into the URL, Guzzle and other HTTP clients will only create one value, as the array key will be seen to be the same and override the previous value. It is better to use an index to create unique array elements.\nNote the two square brackets added behind the value to make it into an array:\n/data?\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=STATE&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][operator]=IN&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value][1]=MI&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value][2]=VA&\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value][3]=MA\nSort Results\nUse the sort query parameter to specify which column the results should be sorted by:\nLowest first:\n\n/data?\n   sort=NPI\n   \nHighest first:\n\n/data?\n   sort=-NPI\nSubset Columns\nAdd a comma-separated string of column names to the column query parameter to limit the columns returned:\n/data?\n   column=NPI,FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME\nOnly Published Nodes\nA very common scenario is to only load the nodes that are published. This is a very easy filter to add.\nSHORT\n   filter[status][value]=1\n\nNORMAL\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=status\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value]=1\nNodes by Value of Entity Reference\nA common strategy is to filter content by a entity reference.\nSHORT\n   filter[uid.id][value]=BB09E2CD-9487-44BC-B219-3DC03D6820CD\n\nNORMAL\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=uid.id\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value]=BB09E2CD-9487-44BC-B219-3DC03D6820CD\nTo fully comply with the JSON API specification, while Drupal internally uses the uuid property, JSON:API uses id instead.\nSince Drupal 9.3 it is possible to filter on target_id also instead of only filtering by uuid property.\nSHORT\n   filter[field_tags.meta.drupal_internal__target_id]=1\n\nNORMAL\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=field_tags.meta.drupal_internal__target_id\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value]=1\nNested Filters\nIt’s possible to filter on fields from referenced entities like the user, taxonomy fields or any entity reference field. You can do this easily but just using the the following notation. reference_field.nested_field. In this example the reference field is uid for the user and name which is a field of the user entity.\nSHORT\n   filter[uid.name][value]=admin\n\nNORMAL\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=uid.name\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value]=admin\nFiltering with Arrays\nYou can give multiple values to a filter for it to search in. Next to the field and value keys you can add an operator to your condition.\nUsually it’s \"=\" but you can also use \"IN\", \"NOT IN\", \"&gt;\", \"&lt;\", \"&lt;&gt;\", BETWEEN“.\nFor this example we’re going to use the \"IN\" operator. Note that I added two square brackets behind the value to make it into an array.\nNORMAL\n   filter[fID-1][condition][path]=uid.name\n   filter[fID-1][condition][operator]=IN\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value][1]=admin\n   filter[fID-1][condition][value][2]=john\nGrouping Filters\nNow let’s combine some of the examples above and create the following scenario. WHERE user.name = admin AND node.status = 1:\nfilter[and-group][group][conjunction]=AND\nfilter[name-filter][condition][path]=uid.name\nfilter[name-filter][condition][value]=admin\nfilter[name-filter][condition][memberOf]=and-group\nfilter[status-filter][condition][path]=status\nfilter[status-filter][condition][value]=1\nfilter[status-filter][condition][memberOf]=and-group\nYou don’t really have to add the and-group but I find that a bit easier usually.\nGrouping Grouped Filters\nLike mentioned in the grouping section, you can put groups into other groups. WHERE (user.name = admin) AND (node.sticky = 1 OR node.promoted = 1)\nTo do this we put sticky and promoted into a group with conjunction OR. Create a group with conjunction AND and put the admin filter, and the promoted/sticky OR group into that.\n# Create an AND and an OR GROUP\nfilter[and-group][group][conjunction]=AND\nfilter[or-group][group][conjunction]=OR\n\n# Put the OR group into the AND GROUP\nfilter[or-group][group][memberOf]=and-group\n\n# Create the admin filter and put it in the AND GROUP\nfilter[admin-filter][condition][path]=uid.name\nfilter[admin-filter][condition][value]=admin\nfilter[admin-filter][condition][memberOf]=and-group\n\n# Create the sticky filter and put it in the OR GROUP\nfilter[sticky-filter][condition][path]=sticky\nfilter[sticky-filter][condition][value]=1\nfilter[sticky-filter][condition][memberOf]=or-group\n\n# Create the promoted filter and put it in the OR GROUP\nfilter[promote-filter][condition][path]=promote\nfilter[promote-filter][condition][value]=1\nfilter[promote-filter][condition][memberOf]=or-group\nFilter for nodes where ‘title’ CONTAINS “Foo”\nSHORT\nfilter[title][operator]=CONTAINS&filter[title][value]=Foo\n\nNORMAL\nfilter[title-filter][condition][path]=title\nfilter[title-filter][condition][operator]=CONTAINS\nfilter[title-filter][condition][value]=Foo\nFilter by non-standard complex fields (e.g. addressfield)\nFILTER BY LOCALITY\nfilter[field_address][condition][path]=field_address.locality\nfilter[field_address][condition][value]=Mordor\n\nFILTER BY ADDRESS LINE\nfilter[address][condition][path]=field_address.address_line1\nfilter[address][condition][value]=Rings Street\nFiltering on Taxonomy term values (e.g. tags)\nFor filtering you’ll need to use the machine name of the vocabulary and the field which is present on your node.\nfilter[taxonomy_term--tags][condition][path]=field_tags.name\nfilter[taxonomy_term--tags][condition][operator]=IN\nfilter[taxonomy_term--tags][condition][value][]=tagname\nFiltering on Date (Date only, no time)\nDates are filterable. Pass a time string that adheres to the ISO-8601 format.\nThis example is for a Date field that is set to be date only (no time).\nfilter[datefilter][condition][path]=field_test_date\nfilter[datefilter][condition][operator]=%3D\nfilter[datefilter][condition][value]=2019-06-27\nThis example is for a Date field that supports date and time.\nfilter[datefilter][condition][path]=field_test_date\nfilter[datefilter][condition][operator]=%3D\nfilter[datefilter][condition][value]=2019-06-27T16%3A00%3A00\nNote that timestamp fields (like created or changed) currently must use a timestamp for filtering:\nfilter[recent][condition][path]=created\nfilter[recent][condition][operator]=%3D\nfilter[recent][condition][value]=1591627496\nFiltering on empty array fields\nThis example is for a Checkboxes/Radio buttons field with no value selected. Consider you have a field that is a checkbox. You would like to get all nodes that do not have that value checked. When checked, the JSON API returns an array:\n\"my_field\":[\"checked\"]\nWhen unchecked, the JSON API returns an empty array:\n\"my_field\": [] \nIf you would like to get all fields that are unchecked, you must use the IS NULL on the array as follows (without a value):\nfilter[my-filter][condition][path]=my_field\nfilter[my-filter][condition][operator]=IS NULL",
