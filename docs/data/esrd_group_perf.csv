AGG_ID,The Aggregation Group ID. The aggregation group for a subsidiary ESRD facility includes all ESRD facilities owned in whole or in part by the same legal entity located in the same Hospital Referral Region in which the ESRD facility is located. An ESRD facility that is not a Subsidiary ESRD facility is not included in an aggregation group but will have its own aggregation group ID.
HRR_NUM_MY,The Hospital Referral Region number during the Measurement Year.
HDR_MY,"For Measurement Year 1 and Measurement Year 2, the Home Dialysis Rate for an aggregation group is the percent of attributed ESRD beneficiary months in which ESRD beneficiaries received dialysis at home or self-dialysis in-center during the Measurement Year. For Measurement Year 3 through Measurement Year 10, the Home Dialysis Rate for an aggregation group is the percent of attributed ESRD beneficiary months in which ESRD beneficiaries received dialysis at home, or self-dialysis in-center, or nocturnal in-center dialysis. The same Home Dialysis Rate is used for achievement scoring and improvement scoring."

TR_MY_ACHSCR,"The Transplant Rate for an aggregation group of ESRD facilities is the sum of the Transplant Waitlist Rate and Living Donor Transplant Rate. The Transplant Rate displayed here is used for achievement scoring.

TR_MY_IMPSCR,"The Transplant Rate for an aggregation group of ESRD facilities is the sum of the Transplant Waitlist Rate and Living Donor Transplant Rate. The Transplant Waitlist Rate and Living Donor Transplant Rate do not include beneficiary months from beneficiaries who are 75 years of age or older at any point during the month. For Measurement Year 3 through Measurement Year 10, the Transplant Waitlist Rate and Living Donor Transplant Rate also do not include beneficiary months from beneficiaries who had a vital solid organ cancer diagnosis and were receiving treatment with chemotherapy or radiation for vital solid organ cancer during the Measurement Year. The Transplant Rate displayed here is used for improvement scoring. For transplant, the achievement scoring rate differs slightly from the improvement scoring rate due to differences in reference population groups used for risk adjusting transplant waitlist rates in the Measurement Year."

LDT_DNM_MY,"The Living Donor Transplant Rate's denominator is the number of attributed ESRD beneficiary months at the aggregation group level during the Measurement Year. For each aggregation group of ESRD facilities, the Living Donor Transplant Rate's denominator is the same as its Transplant Waitlist Rate's denominator."
LDT_NUM_MY,The Living Donor Transplant Rate's numerator is the number of attributed beneficiary months for living donor transplant beneficiaries at the aggregation group level during the Measurement Year. Beneficiary months included in the numerator are composed of those months between the beginning of the Measurement Year up to and including the month of the transplant for Living Donor Transplant beneficiaries attributed to an ESRD facility during the month of the transplant.
BENECNT_LDT_MY,Number of Living Donor Transplant beneficiaries during the Measurement Year.
HEI_HDR,"From Measurement Year 3 onwards, CMS incentivizes ETC Participants to decrease disparities in the Home Dialysis Rate and the Transplant Rate between beneficiaries who are dual-eligible or Low-Income Subsidy recipients (DE/LIS) and those who are not by adding a Health Equity Incentive to the improvement scoring methodology. An ETC Participant earns the Health Equity Incentive for the Home Dialysis Rate improvement score if the Home Dialysis Rate for the Measurement Year is at least 2.5 percentage points higher than the corresponding Benchmark Year rate for attributed ESRD beneficiaries who are dual-eligible or DE/LIS. If the ETC Participant earns the Health Equity Incentive for the Home Dialysis Rate improvement score, CMS adds 0.5 points to the ETC Participant's Home Dialysis Rate improvement score. Only applicable from Measurement Year 3 onwards."
HDR_DELIS_DIFF,The difference between the Benchmark Year and Measurement Year in the Home Dialysis Rate for attributed ESRD beneficiaries who are dual eligible or Low Income Subsidy recipients (DE/LIS). Only applicable from Measurement Year 3 onwards.
HDR_DELIS_MY,The Home Dialysis Rate in the Measurement Year for attributed ESRD beneficiaries who are dual eligible or Low Income Subsidy recipients (DE/LIS). Only applicable from Measurement Year 3 onwards.
HDR_DNM_DELIS_MY,Health Equity Incentive Home Dialysis Rate's denominator is the number of attributed ESRD beneficiary months at the aggregation group level during the Measurement Year for attributed ESRD beneficiaries who are dual eligible or Low Income Subsidy recipients (DE/LIS). Only applicable from Measurement Year 3 onwards.
HDR_NUM_DELIS_MY,"Health Equity Incentive Home Dialysis Rate's numerator is the number of home dialysis treatment beneficiary months, plus one half the total number of self-dialysis in-center treatment beneficiary months, plus one half the total number of nocturnal in-center dialysis treatment beneficiary months during the Measurement Year, for attributed ESRD beneficiaries who are dual eligible or Low Income Subsidy recipients (DE/LIS). Only applicable from Measurement Year 3 onwards."

Only applicable from Measurement Year 3 onwards."
LDT_NUM_DELIS_MY,Number of dual eligible or Low Income Subsidy (DE/LIS) beneficiary months for living donor transplant beneficiaries at the aggregation group level during the Measurement Year. Only applicable from Measurement Year 3 onwards.
MPS,"The Modality Performance Score is a weighted sum of the higher of the achievement score or the improvement score for the ETC Participant's Home Dialysis Rate and Transplant Rate. For Measurement Year 1 and 2 the MPS = 2 Ã— (max(Home Dialysis Rate Achievement, Improvement Score)) + (max(Transplant Rate Schievement, Improvement Score)). For Measurement Year 3 through Measurement Year 10, the MPS=2Ã—(The higher of the home dialysis achievement or (home dialysis improvement score + Health Equity Bonus))+(The higher of the transplant achievement or (transplant improvement score + Health Equity Bonus))."
PPA,The Performance Period Adjustment (PPA) is an upward or downward payment adjustment that is made on all dialysis claims with claim service dates during the corresponding PPA period based on an ETC Participant's Home Dialysis Rate and Transplant Rate related performance during the Measurement Year.
PPA_PERIOD,6-month period during which the payments are adjusted based on ETC Participants' performance in each Measurement Year.
MY,12-month period for which achievement and improvement on the home dialysis rate and transplant rate are assessed for the purpose of calculating ETC Participants' MPS and PPA.
