NADAC Data Dictionary,explanation_code,"Codes that pertain to how the NADAC was calculated; see explanation code descriptions below.  Code 1: The NADAC was calculated using information from the most recently completed pharmacy survey. Code 2: The average acquisition cost of the most recent survey was within  2%of the current NADAC; therefore, the NADAC was carried forward from the previous file. Code 3: The NADAC based on survey data has been adjusted to reflect changes in published pricing, or as a result of an inquiry to the help desk. Code 4: The NADAC was carried forward from the previous file. Code 5: The NADAC was calculated based on package size. Code 6: The CMS Covered Outpatient Drug Product File drug category type of 'S/I/N' (Single Source/Innovator/Non-Innovator) has not been applied. Most 'S/I' drugs with the same strength, dosage form and route of administration were grouped together for the purpose of the NADAC calculation and 'N' drugs were also grouped together. In some cases, however, in calculating a NADAC, the CMS 'S/I/N' designation was not applied when the State Medicaid brand or generic payment practices for these drugs generally differed from the Covered Outpatient Drug Product File designation.  For example, authorized generic drugs are appropriately listed in the CMS covered outpatient drug file as I drugs for the purpose of rebates as they were approved under a New Drug Application (NDA). However, they are grouped as 'N' for the NADAC calculation since they are generally designated as generic by most State Medicaid programs for the purposes of reimbursement. Another example of this occurrence is when proprietary named drugs, approved under an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) are appropriately in the CMS Covered Outpatient Drug file as 'N' for the purpose of rebates. However, they are grouped as 'S/I' for the NADAC calculation since they are generally reimbursed as brand drugs by State Medicaid programs. Codes 7 through 10: Reserved for future use."

For drugs marketed without an FDA-approved application (e.g. OTC monograph, unapproved drug), the earliest date the drug was first marketed by any labeler. For all drugs (i.e., those marketed with or without an FDA-approved application), if a drug was purchased or otherwise acquired from another labeler, the Market Date should be equal to the Market Date of the original product. Thus, the Market Date of a drug is frequently not the date on which a labeler began marketing the drug, but may be a much earlier date. If a Market Date falls on a date that is earlier than 9/30/1990, CMS will change it to 9/30/1990 in both the Medicaid Drug Rebate (MDR) system and the Drug Data Reporting for Medicaid (DDR) system since dates earlier than the start of the Drug Rebate Program have no bearing on the program.

It is important to note that while the FDA generally assigns a two letter TE Code value (e.g., AB) to products, in some cases the value is two letters plus a number (e.g., AB1). Since DDR restricts values reported in the TEC field to two characters, some FDA TE Codes need to be converted to a two-character format.

Current Separate CHIP Enrollment by Month and State Data Dictionary,t-msis_data_through_month,"The most recent month of enrollment data available in the T-MSIS submission used to calculate S-CHIP enrollment for the state and coverage month. States generally report information into T-MSIS on the eligibility, claims, and financial data in their systems by the end of the month following the reporting month. For example, states generally submit T-MSIS data covering the individuals enrolled in the program in April at some point in May. States can continue to make updates to the information for that reporting period in subsequent monthly T-MSIS submissions. Each month, the T-MSIS data are converted into the T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF), which are optimized for monitoring and research purposes. The production of the TAF occur in the month following most states T-MSIS submission. For example, T-MSIS data covering individuals enrolled in the program in April is reported by states in May, and the TAF data for the April period are first produced in June. The TAF data for the April period will then be updated every month for the next 13 months, incorporating any new or changed T-MSIS data related to the April period. States can continue to update data beyond that period, but updates will not necessarily be reflected in the TAF data."

Current Separate CHIP Enrollment by Month and State Data Dictionary,data_notes,"Data notes. In T-MSIS, states submit a CHIP Code and an Eligibility Group for each enrollee. The CHIP Code indicates whether the individual is enrolled in Medicaid, Medicaid-expansion CHIP, or S-CHIP. The Eligibility Group indicates the specific eligibility pathway that is applicable to the individual based on the states eligibility determination process. Certain Eligibility Groups (codes 61-68) should only be used for S-CHIP enrollees. If more than 5% of the S-CHIP enrollees in TAF have a missing Eligibility Group or an Eligibility Group not associated with S-CHIP, the following data note is applied: S-CHIP enrollment may be inaccurate due to misalignment between Medicaid/CHIP classification and eligibility groups.
